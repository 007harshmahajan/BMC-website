                <h3><span>Brand Presentation</span></h3>
                <p>It’s vital to read case studies of a brand to understand the decision-making points and strategic turmoil, no better way than a brand presentation. We organised a Brand presentation where the participating teams studied and analysed the journey of a company becoming a brand. They curated and presented every insight they had, along with all the conclusions they drew from their case studies. This event expanded our horizons.</p>

                <h3><span>Business Hackathon</span></h3>
                <p>What is the possible best way of learning something?<br>The answer is doing it. To get the entrepreneurial brains on their feet, we organised a business hackathon, with Mr. Pradeep Karambelkar (Executive Director- BNI Bhopal) and Heli kools (Director- BUZZMETER) as jury members. The hackathon was sponsored by Edo Square and Markytics. Participants from all over India showcased their skills and got a chance to avail funding up to 1 crore. With all the funds for organisation raised by students, we lived by the spirit of a business hackathon.</p>

                <h3><span>Business Quiz</span></h3>
                <p>A fun way to test one’s knowledge is quizzes. Though execution is the key in the business world, you have an edge if you have enough knowledge about it, making it wise to learn and test it. A business quiz seems like a great idea for this, which is exactly what we did. It gave every participant a reality check of how deep the waters are.</p>

                <h3><span>AdMad</span></h3>
                <p>A successful startup heavily depends upon marketing and reach. To understand the vital but minute details of marketing and strategic planning, we hosted AdMad and challenged the participants to take a well-known product, hide its brand, and market it in their way. It may seem easy to you while reading. However, if you experienced it, you would know the grind. This event polished our marketing thumb.</p>
